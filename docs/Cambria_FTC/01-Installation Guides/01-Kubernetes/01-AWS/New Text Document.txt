## ⚠️ Critical Information: Read Before Proceeding

Before starting the installation, review the following key points:

### 1. A New Kubernetes Cluster Will Be Deployed
The installation process creates a **brand-new AWS EKS cluster**, isolated from other applications.

### 2. Default Installation is Non-Secure
- The default deployment uses open, non-secure settings.  
- Secure or hardened deployments require AWS expertise (not covered in this guide).  
- Firewall details are provided in **Section 1.5**.

### 3. Understand Your Transcoding Requirements
Know your:
- Expected encoding workload  
- Input/output specifications  
- GPU requirements  

See **Section 1.3** for AWS machine recommendations.

### 4. Administrative AWS Rights Required
Many steps require IAM-level administrative permissions in AWS.

### 5. Verify AWS Account Quota
Ensure your AWS account has enough quota to deploy all required EKS resources  
(see **Section 1.2**).

### 6. A Separate Linux Machine is Required
A dedicated Linux machine is required to:
- Install AWS and Kubernetes tools  
- Run AWS CLI  
- Safely store kubeconfig files  

### 7. Verify Region-Specific Resource Availability
GPU availability and instance types vary by AWS region.  
Check AWS documentation to confirm support in your region of operation.
