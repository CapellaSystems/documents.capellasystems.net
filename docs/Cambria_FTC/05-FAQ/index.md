<summary>Filters</summary>

**Q:** What is the difference between adding filters in the Source tab versus the Transcoding settings, and what happens if I use both?
**A:** If you have a stitched source, adding filters in the Source tab lets you apply them to just one file, and the filter is applied in the source's original resolution and frame rate. In the Transcoding settings, you can choose whether the filter is applied to the source's original resolution and frame rate as a Source filter or after it has been converted to the target format as a Target filter.

**Q:** My machine stopped working and it had a node-locked license. How can I move the license to the new machine?
**A:** Please contact support@capellasystems.net. We will deactivate the license on the machine that is no longer working, allowing you to transfer it to the new machine.

**Q:** I would like an offline node-locked license. How do I do this?
**A:** In Capella License Manager, under "Activation Tool," check "Use Offline Activation/Deactivation." Then send the generated request.txt file to support@capellasystems.net. We will provide an offlineResponse.dat file that you can use to complete the offline activation.
