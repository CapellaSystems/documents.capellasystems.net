<p><strong>EZTitles plugin has reached the end of its life-cycle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Capella EZTitles plug-in will no longer be in active development because the plug-in product has come to the end of its life-cycle.</li>
<li>EZTitles will no longer provide customer support for the plug-in, although existing installations are expected to continue to work at this time.</li>
<li>Please contact Capella with your caption/subtitle requests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Removal of non-HTTPS APIs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The methods of the API must be executed using HTTPS.  HTTP has been removed and will no longer work.  To use HTTPS, simply use the “https://” prefix instead of the “http://” prefix for the URIs.  For FTC the port number used for HTTPS methods is 8648.  For Cluster the port number used for HTTPS is 8650.</li>
<li>SNMP support for Cluster/FTC was using non-HTTPS API.  For the 5.1.0.12651 build of Cluster/FTC, SNMP has been disabled.  We will look into adding support back in for a future build.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL upgrade</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Database migration between Postgres 9.3 and 14.3 is not automatic</li>
<li>Installing Cluster/FTC ver. 5.0 will come with a clean Database (Postgres 14.3)</li>
<li>If you are upgrading from FTC versions 4.8 (or lower) to 5.0 then Postgres 9.3 will still be installed on the system, which will be used to migrate all of the information to Postgres 14.3</li>
<li>Only migration from Postgres 9.3 (FTC versions 4.8 or lower) to Postgres 14.3 (FTC 5.0 and above) is supported.</li>
<li>Please read the migration document below on how to migrate the database:</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/otias8vdolo6215/Postgres%2014.3%20Migration%20Document.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/otias8vdolo6215/Postgres%2014.3%20Migration%20Document.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.dropbox.com/s/otias8vdolo6215/Postgres%2014.3%20Migration%20Document.pdf?dl=0</a></li>
<li><em><strong>Downgrading note: Downgrading from FTC 4.5 (or higher) to FTC 4.0 is not supported. The database will be corrupted.</strong></em></li>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="licensing-notes">Licensing Notes<a href="#licensing-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Licensing Notes" title="Direct link to Licensing Notes">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>If you are using a build older than Floating License Server 4.5 or Cluster/FTC 4.5, there is a good chance the online activation license has stopped working sometime after May 2021.</li>
<li>If you are using Cluster/FTC <strong>without</strong> the Floating License Server, then all you will need to do is update  Cluster/FTC to v4.5 or higher.</li>
<li>If you are using Floating License Server then you will need to update to v4.5 or higher and Capella will need to issue you new Activation Keys.</li>
<li>Offline licenses will continue to work.</li>
<li>Please contact <a href="mailto:sales@capellasystems.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales@capellasystems.net</a> for instructions for additional instructions.</li>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="system-requirements">System Requirements<a href="#system-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to System Requirements" title="Direct link to System Requirements">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Operating System: Windows 10 (64 bit), Windows 11, Windows Server (64 bit) 2016 / 2019 / 2022, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 recommended)
Processor: Intel 2.8GHz (Quad-Core) or faster<br>
<!-- -->Memory: 8GB or more (4K/8K encoding requires more memory, 32GB or more suggested)<br>
<!-- -->Video Card: Supports Direct3D acceleration<br>
<!-- -->OS Installation note: File Convert and Cluster installation requires additional system files included in recent Windows Update.  If you encounter issues during installation, please conduct &quot;Windows Update&quot;, reboot, and try again.</p>
<p><em><strong>Warning for machines with more than 64 cores or machines that have multiple processor groups</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cluster/FTC support of multiple processor groups requires the Capella License option <strong>“Windows Multi-Processor Group Support (more than 64 logical processors)”</strong>.  Without this license option, FTC will only utilize only one of the processor groups for all FTC Jobs run on the machine.  If the license option is enabled, FTC will distribute multiple Jobs to each processor group.  However, a single job will still only use one processor group at a time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommended Configuration</strong></p>
<p>Operating System: Windows 10 (64 bit), Windows 11, Windows Server 2016/2019/2022, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3  Platform: HP Z4<br>
<!-- -->CPU: 1x Intel Core i9-10980XE @ 3.00GHz (18-core Cascade Lake)<br>
<!-- -->Memory: 64 GB (4x16 GB) DDR4-3200<br>
<!-- -->Video Card: Supports Direct3D acceleration<br>
<!-- -->Network Adapter: Gigabit Ethernet (Wired Connection) or 10 Gigabit Ethernet<br>
<!-- -->System Drive: 1TB Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD  </p>

<p>Machine Administrator for Installation:<br>
<!-- -->It is required that machine administrator account be used for the Cambria software installation. After installation, a non-administrator account can be used for normal File Convert operation. However, for Cluster it is required that the logon user has administrator privilege. Cluster service by default is logon with LOCALSYSTEM, which has administrator privilege. If it is being logon with other users, that user must be a local administrator as well. Otherwise, the Cluster may not start.</p>
<p>To add a user to local administrator: Run lusrmgr.msc, go to Groups -&gt; Administrators, Add that user to this group.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="service-credentials">Service Credentials<a href="#service-credentials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Service Credentials" title="Direct link to Service Credentials">​</a></h4>
<p>After installation check the Capella CpServiceManager (File Convert) or CpClusterManager (Cluster) service!  These services will need to have the appropriate access rights to read from and write to network file locations. Here are the instructions on how to modify ‘Capella CpServiceManager’ service credentials:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Services panel (Control Panel&gt;Administrative Tools&gt;Services)</li>
<li>Open Properties panel for Capella CpServiceManager</li>
<li>In the Log On tab, select “This account:”</li>
<li>Enter the full domain account and password. (ie. <a href="mailto:Yourname@company.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yourname@company.com</a>)</li>
<li>This domain account must have access rights to the locations</li>
<li>Restart the service as prompted</li>

<p>To prevent some memory allocation errors that can occur, we recommend changing a Windows Virtual Memory setting to allow for “System managed size”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up to the Advanced tab in the System Properties panel (Control Panel&gt;System and Security&gt;System&gt;Advanced system settings)</li>
<li>Select Settings ``under Performance</li>
<li>From the Advanced tab select Change under Virtual Memory</li>

When a script or an executable is registered as trusted, it means that the user or the system administrator has explicitly allowed it to run on the machine. Without this trust, any script or executable could potentially run on a machine, including those that are malicious or harmful.<br><br> By registering trusted executables and scripts, organizations can ensure that only authorized programs are executed on their machines, thereby reducing the risk of malware infections, data theft, and other security breaches. Additionally, the trusted list can help prevent unauthorized modifications to scripts or executables, as any change to the program will change its SHA256 hash, requiring the trusted list to be updated. <br><br>Overall, the registration of trusted executables and scripts is an important security measure that helps to mitigate the risk of security incidents caused by malicious programs, and organizations should take this process seriously to ensure the safety of their systems and data. <br><br>Here are some instructions for using the features described: <br><strong>Registering Trusted Executables:</strong> <br>To register a trusted executable on a machine, follow these steps: <br>a. Generate the SHA256 hash for the executable file you want to register. <br>b. Open the registry editor by typing &quot;regedit&quot; in the search bar or the Run dialog box (press Win+R). <br>c. Navigate to the following registry key:<br> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\CAPELLA\CAMBRIA. <br>d. Create a new string value called &quot;TrustedAppSHA256&quot;. <br>e. Set the value of the &quot;TrustedAppSHA256&quot; to be the SHA256 of the executable, separated by commas if there are multiple executables. <br>f. Repeat these steps for each machine where you want to register the trusted executable. <br><br>Alternatively, you can create a .reg file with the SHA256 of the trusted executable and run it as administrator on each machine where you want to register the executable. <br><br><strong>Registering Trusted Perl Scripts:</strong> <br>To register a trusted Perl script, follow the same steps as above, but use the &quot;TrustedScriptSHA256&quot; registry key instead of &quot;TrustedAppSHA256&quot;. Note that any changes made to a Perl script will change its SHA256, so the trusted list will need to be updated accordingly. <br><br><strong>Using Python Scripts:</strong> <br>Python scripts are executed in a sandbox, so they don&#x27;t need to be registered as trusted. However, they will not have access to the network, which can be necessary for some workflows. <br><br><strong>Security Considerations:</strong> <br>It&#x27;s important to note that any trusted executable will be allowed to be called with different arguments, so users need to make sure that trusted executables can&#x27;t cause any damage with other arguments. For example, if a trusted executable takes a file name as an argument, it should check that the file is of the expected type and doesn&#x27;t contain any malicious code. Similarly, if a Perl script takes user input, it should validate the input to prevent injection attacks. If network access is not needed, it&#x27;s recommended to use Python scripts instead of Perl scripts to reduce the risk of security issues. <br><br>Please contact your IT department to assist with properly identifying which executables and scripts may be risky.</td><td>18370, 17658</td></tr><tr><td>Kubernetes</td><td><strong>AWS Kubernetes Support</strong> <br><br>Link to installation guide: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xt7vj917tg9bejo0r6x8d/Cambria_Cluster_and_FTC_RC1_5_2_0_on_AWS_Kubernetes.pdf?rlkey=zr11ja7gk7fkh37ucw7nw4dsl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xt7vj917tg9bejo0r6x8d/​Cambria_Cluster_and_FTC_RC1_5_2_0_on_AWS_Kubernetes.pdf?rlkey=zr11ja7gk7fkh37ucw7nw4dsl</a></td><td>18280</td></tr><tr><td>Kubernetes</td><td><strong>Argo Events to FTC Job</strong> <br><br>Argo Events can be used to trigger FTC encoding jobs.</td><td>17939, 18136, 18270</td></tr><tr><td>Kubernetes</td><td><strong>Akamai NetStorage Watcher</strong> <br><br>NetStorage Watcher can be used with Argo Events (webhook) to trigger FTC jobs.

Selecting this setting allows for a local Watch Folder to also &quot;watch&quot; a NetStorage location and use sources directly without having to transfer it first. <br><br>2. For API users. Added support for specifying the NetStorage credentials in FTC JobXMLs. The attribute &quot;netstorage_secret_key&quot; in the <code>&lt;JobDescr&gt;&lt;/JobDescr&gt;</code> tag which allows the user to specify their NetStorage HTTP API Key for reading files from and uploading files to NetStorage, and the format for reading file from storage: <code>[netstorage]&lt;netstorage username&gt;@&lt;netstorage domain&gt;:&lt;path to the source in netstorage&gt;</code> <br><br>Example:<br> <code>&lt;JobDescr netstorage_secret_key=&quot;adfsd&quot;&gt;</code><br> <code>...</code> <br><code>&lt;Source Location=&quot;[netstorage]user@netstorage_domain:path/folder/myFile.mp4&quot; </code><br><code>Name=&quot;Src1&quot; /&gt;</code> <br> <code>...</code> <br><code>&lt;/JobDescr&gt;</code></td><td>16342, 16341</td></tr><tr><td>Audio Track Mapping</td><td><strong>Track Name Label</strong> <br><br>Track Name Label added to the Audio Track Mapping dialog box to allow for user description for the various tracks.

The VITC Extractor takes VITC timecode information stored in the source and uses it in some way (currently only to be reused with the burn-in filter). <br><br>Notes:<br> 1. In order to use VITC generator, the source needs to have a frame width of 720 (if source filter) or target (if target filter) <br>2. In the FTC UI, both of the VITC filters don&#x27;t have any configurable options for the filters themselves <br>3. For VITC Generator, the source needs to either already have timecode embedded or a timecode overwrite filter needs to be used alongside it. If using timecode filter, the timecode filter needs to activate first. This means the order of these filters matters. <br>4. For VITC Extractor, the filter needs to be used as a source filter (whether it is used directly as a source filter or on the preset side). <br>5. The only ways to get VITC Extractor works as a target side filter is when same as source is used for encoding settings such as frame size, frame rate, and interlacing or VITC generator + VITC extractor are used in the same job in that order (Eg. Job with Timecode overwrite + VITC generator + VITC extractor + Timecode burn-in)</td><td>15958</td></tr><tr><td>Filter (NexGuard)</td><td><strong>NexGuard v2 filter enhancement</strong> <br><br>In our NexGuard v2 filter, we have now included a way to do ClipMark watermarking, along with G2 (which was already there before). In order to do ClipMark watermarking, you need an appropriate license from NexGuard. <br><br>Licensing note: NexGuard Watermarking V2 For FTC 4.8 has changed licenses due to NexGuard (NAGRA) requirements. Hence, your existing Nexguard watermarking licenses will not work. Please obtain new licenses from NexGuard.</td><td>15989</td></tr><tr><td>Windows OS</td><td><strong>Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 Supported</strong></td><td>16483</td></tr></tbody></table>

Edit an existing FTC job or project and add the pre-signed url to the location you&#x27;d like to use the resource (such as Source, Logo Filter source, etc). <br>3. If a JobXML, queue the job and check that the job runs successfully. If an FTC project, see if the source loads into FTC and that it acts similar to what the source would be like in local storage. <br><br>Limitation: For Pre-Signed URLs, images cannot be used as file sources into FTC because FTC image sources in FTC are decoded as a sequence.

MXF (XDCAM) sources cannot be used with this function. <br>- If a source is detected as a High-10 profile and 4:2:2 10-bit, the create preset function will create a 4:2:0 10-bit preset. This occurs because High-10 does not support 4:2:2. <br>- The MPEG-2 decoder will always decode the file with the color format YUV 4:2:2. Because of this, the video properties will always show YUV 4:2:2 for all MPEG-2 videos. <br>- Some files, especially longer files may take a long time to analyze. You can modify the ‘Analysis Duration’ for the options tab in the main UI. Setting this to ‘Partial’ will limit the analysis to the first 2 minutes of the file.

It is recommended that you “Queue” the job or use Watch Folders. Also, when the ‘Notification Event Type’ is set to ‘On Job Start’, the duration shown in the log will be 00:00:00 because the database does not have the updated source duration at that point.</td><td>8339, 10258</td></tr><tr><td>Target (Scriptable Workflow)</td><td><strong>Job stalls due to scripts</strong> <br><br>During script phase, our job&#x27;s progress does not increase, this is detected as &#x27;no progress&#x27; internally.

This is not a limitation when the filter is used on the source side (or when adding a source side filter to the target).</td><td>6976</td></tr><tr><td>Filter</td><td><strong>DVD Subtitle Burn-in (from a DVD IFO source file)</strong> <br><br>Available settings: <br>1. Subtitle Language - DVD&#x27;s can contain multiple subtitles. There can be English, Japanese, and/or Spanish subtitles in a DVD. <br>Choose the subtitle language you want displayed in this section. <br>2. Subtitle Language Index - Each language may contain different subtitles. For example, if Chinese is picked from the Subtitle Language there can be two ways to write the characters. Index 0 is chosen by default and will always contain subtitle information if the Subtitle Language is supported by the .IFO. To choose the second subtitle style, choose Index 1. <br><br>Limitations: <br>1. If the IFO contains lots of CHG_COLCON subtitles in a &quot;burst&quot;, we may consume lots of memory. <br>2. We currently do not support previews of subtitle information.</td><td>4134</td></tr><tr><td>Filter (Preview)</td><td><strong>Logo filter preview does not display logo when ‘apply to segment’ is used</strong></td><td>8899</td></tr><tr><td>Filter (Preview)</td><td><strong>Filter Preview Enhancement</strong> <br><br>Filters can now be previewed all at once. By default, all filters are previewed. You can right click on the filter preview and select or deselect filters that are included in the preview. Preview for different filters can also be enabled/disabled during playback. Some filters cannot be previewed and are not included in preview. A “*” is shown next to the current filter being edited. <br><br>Note: Source filters and target filters are not previewed at the same time. When editing a source filter, the preview will only show source filters. When editing target filters, the preview will only show target filters.</td><td>6601</td></tr><tr><td>Filter (Timecode Burn-in)</td><td><strong>Multiple timecode sources</strong> <br><br>In the case that there are multiple timecodes in a source, the timecode burn-in filter will now choose the most significant one. <br><br>For example, the user has a source with MPEG-2 GOP timecode and VITC timecode. In our case, the VITC timecode takes precedence over the MPEG-2 GOP timecode and so the Timecode Burn-In Filter will use the VITC timecode. <br><br>The ordering of the filters matter in this case as the burn-in filter chooses the most significant one. <br><br>For example, if the user wants to burn-in the VITC timecode, the VITC extractor filter should come before the timecode burn-in. If you want the MPEG-2 GOP timecode and VITC timecode burned in for example, you&#x27;ll want to first have the timecode burn-in filter for the MPEG-2 GOP timecode, then the VITC extractor, and then the timecode burn-in.</td><td>15991</td></tr><tr><td>Filter (Overwrite Timecode)</td><td><strong>Timecode Overwrite Filter</strong> <br><br>Timecode overwrite filter can make timecode modifications that are applied through the muxer, so timecode that are inside of the video stream will not be affected by this filter for a Passthrough job.</td><td>14446</td></tr><tr><td>Manager</td><td><strong>Job Management</strong> <br><br>Removing a job in the “Starting” state will delete the job from the Job Manager. However, the CPJobExec for the job may still be running in Windows Task Manager. Since the “Starting” state occurs only for a few seconds at the start of a job, this is a rare issue.</td><td>9598</td></tr><tr><td>Manager</td><td><strong>Multiple Cambria Manager UI Instances</strong> <br><br>When there are multiple Cambria Manager user interfaces open on the same machine, the changes made in one UI may not be reflected in other UI. This may lead to some confusion. <br><br>Workaround: You can simply close the Cambria Manager UI that is not updated. Newly launched Cambria Managers will contain all the updated changes.</td><td>6565</td></tr><tr><td>Manager</td><td><strong>Option to control job timeout</strong> <br><br>A timeout setting has been added to the Cambria Manager Option (tab) to allow for increasing the timeout duration to avoid job failure caused by slow network speed.</td><td>5982</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td><strong>Cluster communication uses HTTPS by default as of FTC 3.5</strong> <br><br>While HTTP connection is still possible now, HTTP connection may be deprecated/rejected in a future release. <br><br>Recommendation: It is recommended that external applications that are interfacing with FTC/Cluster web servers via HTTP are retooled to use HTTPS.</td><td>11803</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td>Machines Set To 0 Slots <br><br>Machines that are connected “online” to the Cluster with transcoding slots set to 0 may still accept transcoding jobs. These jobs will remain stuck in a queuing state. In order to avoid this problem, any machines with 0 transcoding slots set should be disconnected (set to “offline”) from the Cluster.</td><td>9738</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td><strong>Converting a Cluster machine to a FTC machine</strong> <br><br>When a Cluster machine is being used in a Backup redundancy role, the role must be set to “no backup” before the Cluster is uninstalled. If this is not done, then when FTC is installed on that machine, the database will be in read only mode and jobs will not function properly on the machine.</td><td>9667</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td><strong>Cambria not compatible with VirtualBox / VMware</strong> <br><br>Cluster and File Convert instances are not compatible with (VirtualBox / VMware Workstation / VMware Player). Machines that have (VirtualBox / VMware Workstation / VMware Player) installed may cause File Convert not to show up in Cluster properly, in addition, File Convert may not be able to receive jobs. <br><br>Note: To avoid this issue FC/Cluster should not be installed on the same machine that (VirtualBox / VMware Workstation / VMware Player) is installed on.</td><td>9010, 6599</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td><strong>Cambria Cluster and Cambria Broadcast Manager cannot be installed on the same machine</strong></td><td>8635</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td><strong>Cluster and File Convert Versions</strong> <br><br>It is recommended for Cluster installations that the same build version for both Cluster and File Convert are used.

If the client machine changes its IP address, then you will need to manually delete the machine from the machines list and add it again.</td><td>6038</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster (Jobs)</td><td><strong>Could Not Connect To File Convert</strong> <br><br>When Cluster Manager shows a lot of &quot;Cluster could not connect to FileConvert machine to Add new job &quot;errors for a particular machine, the causes could be: <br>1. temporary network issues (disconnected) <br>2.  machine is rebooting <br><br>Recommendation: If you are not running into case 1 or case 2. Rebooting the client machine can resolve the problem.</td><td>3341</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster (Job Management)</td><td><strong>Special Job Tags to prevent over distribution of Jobs to a single FTC node</strong> <br><br>Dynamic slots does a good job of distributing tranconding Jobs to the client FTC machines. However, there can be cases where FTC can be oversaturated with lots of Jobs. This can occur when jobs use less CPU at the beginning, and then increases CPU use substantially later. During this period of low CPU use, Cluster may assign too many jobs to the FTC client. A new special Job Tag can be used to prevent this from occurring. <br><br>The Job Tag ‘CPUBaseline=X’ can be used, where X is a user specified number from 1 and 100. When the Job is running, the X value will be used as the minimum reported CPU utilization value for that Job. So, value X or the actual CPU utilized for the job is used, whichever is higher. Cluster will use this reported CPU utilization of all the Jobs running on a FTC machine to decide whether or not to distribute any additional Jobs to the machine. <br><br>Example: CPUBaseline=80<br>When a Job with this tag is running, it will report to Cluster that the Job is using 80% CPU utilization at the very least. If the Job is using more than 80% CPU, the higher value will be reported.<br><br> In addition to using the CPUBaseline tag, a new special Machine Tag has been introduced to allow CPUBaseline to be dynamically adjusted depending on what machine is running the Job. <br><br>The Machine Tag ‘CPUBaselineAdjPct=X’ can be set through the Cluster Manager for any Machine in the Machines list. X can be any number from 0 to 100. CPUBaselineAdjPct is used as a scaling factor for CPUBaseline. This allows the user control over the CPUBaseline value across machines of different processing capability. <br><br>Example: When a CPUBaseline=80 Job is sent to a Machine with CPUBaselineAdjPct=50, then the actual baseline value is scaled (80 * .5) = 40.</td><td>11601</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster (Redunancy)</td><td><strong>Cluster Redundancy</strong> <br><br>A second Cluster Manager can be configured as a Backup Cluster. When the active Cluster becomes unavailable the Backup machine will take over and assume the Cluster Manager’s role. Watch Folders will continue to be monitored and jobs distribution will continue. This feature adds redundancy and eliminates having a single point of failure for the Cluster. <br><br>Limitations / Known Issues: <br>When Redundancy is triggered by rebooting the Redundancy Primary machine, the Redundancy Backup machine becomes the triggered Primary. Upon bootup, the original Primary may not be properly stopped. In this case the Watch processes of the original Primary will still be active. This may lead to duplicate unwanted jobs to be created. Please set the status of the original Primary to ‘Stopped’ if you suspect this is the case.<br><br> If Primary and Backup machines are disconnected from the network at the same time for more six hours, the Redundancy replication will stop (health indicator will be red). If this occurs, the Backup must be configured to point to the Primary IP again. <br><br>Disabling the active network adapters through Windows Network Connections interface can cause the Primary/Backup the Redundancy replication to stop (health indicator will be red). Re-establish the machine roles again to establish a healthy Redundancy connection. <br><br>Redundancy role may become unset after a machine reboot. Re-establish the machine roles again to establish a healthy Redundancy connection. <br><br>Backup machine cannot be used for encoding when it is in Backup role. However if redundancy is triggered and the Backup is promoted to Primary, the machine can be used as an encoding node. <br><br>Due to technical limitation of PostgreSQL database replication, it cannot handle IP changes. So, both Primary and Backup should be assigned with static IP. Please consult network administrators for such settings.</td><td>8426, 8804, 8945, 9042, 9046</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster (REST API)</td><td><strong>API Queuing</strong> <br><br>When using the API to queue jobs to the Cluster for normal Cluster job distribution, you should be using port 8649 for HTTP or 8650 for HTTPS.</td><td>4109</td></tr><tr><td>REST API</td><td><strong>Output Filenames</strong> <br><br>When using the API, the output filenames will show the requested filename. It will only show the true output filenames for a job when the jobs are completed. This behavior is important to note in the case where the Job is writing to an output location where the filename already exists.</td><td>7826</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster (License)</td><td><strong>Cluster Manager</strong> <br><br>Cluster Manager may stop working if the machines system time is rolled back. It is recommended that restart the CpClusterServiceRunner service from (Windows - Service Manager) after the clock has been rolled back. <br><br>Changing the computer clock forwards beyond actual real world time can affect the duration of the license validity when you clock is rolled back. If you are running into an issue with the dongle license, please contact Capella.</td><td>6111</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster (License)</td><td><strong>License Update</strong> <br><br> When updating a dongle license for Cambria Cluster, you should restart the CpClusterServiceRunner service from (Windows - Service Manager) for the license to be detected properly.</td><td>5173</td></tr><tr><td>Licensing (Alternate method)</td><td><strong>Floating License Server / Online Activation</strong> <br><br>Floating License Servers can be used to lease Capella product licenses to physical machines and virtual servers over the network. This feature supports both “on-premise” machines as well as virtual servers on the IBM, Google, and AWS cloud. <br><br>The Floating License Server software is activated using Capella’s new Online Activation licensing. Online Activation is an alternative to Capella’s USB license dongle. Online Activation allows Capella Products to be unlocked on a machine through the internet using a 25-digit activation key. <br><br>Notes: <br>- Floating License Server must be installed on a physical machine. The Windows OS must also be configured to prevent the machine from going to sleep. <br><br>- Updates/Extensions to Licenses by Capella will apply automatically if the license is online. However, it is recommended that users re-activates after Capella makes the change so that the Licenses can be updated immediately. <br><br>- Machines that have Capella Products that are Online Activated should remain connected to the internet. If disconnected, the license will continue to work until the end of the Grace Period (2-3 days), during this time users can reestablish their internet connection.<br><br> If the machine is rebooted while in Grace Period, Capella Product licenses no longer work. The licenses will need to be re-activated via the Online Activation procedure. <br><br>- For Cluster and FTC that are installed onto Virtual Servers, the virtual machines should have a single network adapter and TCP traffic must be enabled (allowed through security group setting/firewall) between the Cluster and FTC. <br><br>- Uninstalling the Floating License Server will automatically deactivate the license. Capella products that were clients of the Floating License Server will automatically go into a 7-day grace period. Installing and reactivating the Floating License Server license again should allow clients to re-establish the connection for the licensing link. <br><br>- Server sync may not update the number of clients/license a floating server has. To workaround this, you will need to manually re-activate the key on the floating server.</td><td>11682, 11819, 11826, 12275, 14409</td></tr><tr><td>License (Activation/Cryptlex)</td><td><strong>Grace Period</strong> <br><br>We support grace period of 10 days after license has suddenly invalidated or fingerprint changed. But, if the machine reboots during grace period (GP) state, then upon boot the License Manager UI will not show the GP state. However the license is in GP state internally.</td><td>16012</td></tr><tr><td>License (USB)</td><td><strong>System Time</strong> <br><br>Changing the computer clock forwards beyond actual real world time can affect the duration of the license validity when you clock is rolled back. If you are running into an issue with the dongle license, please contact Capella.</td><td>6111</td></tr><tr><td>License (USB)</td><td><strong>Reboot After Dongle Update</strong><br><br>After USB dongles are remotely updated, it is recommended that the Cambria machine be rebooted so that the new license features and job queuing functions can apply.</td><td>5173</td></tr><tr><td>License (USB / Software)</td><td><strong>License Issues</strong> <br><br>If the hardware or software license is not plugged in, File Convert will fail to encode when the “Convert All Jobs” button is clicked.
