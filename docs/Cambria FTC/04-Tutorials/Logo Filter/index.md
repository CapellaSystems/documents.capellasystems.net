1. These series of buttons control the scrolling of the source. You may scrub through the source or use the buttons.

From left to right they are: **Go to Beginning**, **Go to Previous Frame**, **Pause / Play**, **Go to Next Frame**, and **Go to End**.
  

2. If you have multiple sources, you can use this box to select which source to apply the filter upon.


3. Instead of using the buttons to scroll the source, you may skip directly to the **time** or **timecode**.


4. This box shows the **current time**, **current timecode**, and **total duration** of the video.
  

5. Click **Browse** to add the source of your logo. The currently supported files for the source of the logo are:

* `.bmp`
* `.jpg`
* `.jpeg`
* `.png`
* `.tif`
* `.tiff`
* `.tga`

You may also add a `.mov` file as a logo. Just select `.mov` in the dropdown menu when browsing.


6. This is where you can adjust the **size**, **transparency**, and **offset** of the logo. You may also choose to apply this filter to a **certain segment** of the source.


7. Click **OK** to apply the filter and save.
