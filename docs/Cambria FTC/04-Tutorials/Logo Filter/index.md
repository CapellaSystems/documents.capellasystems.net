Below is a breakdown of the functions in the logo filters UI

These series of buttons control the scrolling of the source. You may scrub through the source or use the buttons.

From left to right they are: Go to Beginning, Go to Previous Frame, Pause / Play, Go to Next Frame, and Go to End.

If you have multiple sources, you can use this box to select which source to apply the filter upon.

Instead of using the buttons to scroll the source, you may skip directly to the time or timecode.

You may also add a .mov file as a logo.

Just select .mov in the drop down menu when you select browse.

This is where you can adjust the size / transparency / and offset of the logo. You may also choose to apply this filter to a certain segment of the source.
