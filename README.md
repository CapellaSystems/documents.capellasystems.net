### Adding New Documentation

1. **Create your markdown file** in the appropriate folder under `docs/`
2. **Add frontmatter** at the top of the file:
   ```yaml
   ---
   id: unique-document-id
   title: Document Title
   ---
   ```
3. **Update the sidebar** (if needed) - see Sidebar Configuration below

### Folder Naming Convention

Folders use numeric prefixes for ordering: `01-`, `02-`, etc. This ensures consistent ordering in the sidebar when using `autogenerated`.

### Sidebar Configuration

The sidebar is configured in `sidebars.js`. Most sections use `autogenerated` to automatically include all docs in a folder:

```javascript
{
  type: 'autogenerated',
  dirName: 'Cambria_FTC/01-Installation Guides/01-Kubernetes/01-AWS',
}
```

**When adding a new folder:**
1. Create the folder with the appropriate numeric prefix
2. Add your docs inside
3. Add a new `autogenerated` entry in `sidebars.js` if the folder isn't already covered by a parent autogenerated directive

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Serve production build locally
npm run serve
```

### Deployment

Push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch).

### Analytics (GA4)

Site traffic is tracked via **Google Analytics 4**. Configuration is in `docusaurus.config.js` under the `gtag` section.
